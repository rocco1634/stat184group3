###Task 0
```{r task0}
data("OrdwayBirds")
OrdwayBirds2 <-
  OrdwayBirds %>%
  select(SpeciesName, Month, Day) %>%
  mutate(Month = as.numeric(as.character(Month)), Day=as.numeric(as.character(Day)))
data("OrdwaySpeciesNames")
```

###Task 1
How many different species including mis-spellings are in the data?
```{r task1}
summarise(OrdwayBirds2, n_distinct(SpeciesName))
summarise(OrdwaySpeciesNames, n_distinct(SpeciesName))
```
OrdwayBirds has 275 different species including mis-spellings

OrdwaySpeciesNames has 251 distinct species names

Therefore there are 275-251 = 24 misspellings

###Task 2
```{r task2}
CorrectedBirds <-
  OrdwayBirds2 %>%
  inner_join(OrdwaySpeciesNames) %>%
  select(Species = SpeciesNameCleaned, Month, Day) %>%
  na.omit()
```

* Which variable was used for matching cases: `SpeciesName`
* What were the variables that will be added: `Species`

###Task 3
```{r task3}
#Species of more than 1000 designated as major
Majors <-
CorrectedBirds %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  filter(Count >= 1000)
```

###Task 4
```{r task4}
ByMonth <-
CorrectedBirds %>%
  filter(Species %in% Majors$Species) %>%
  group_by(Species, Month) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

ggplot(data=ByMonth,aes(x=reorder(Month,Month),y=Count ,fill=Species))+geom_bar(stat='identity',position='stack', width=.9) 
ggplot(data=ByMonth,aes(x=reorder(Month,Month),y=Count ))+geom_bar(stat='identity',position='stack', width=.9)+ facet_wrap(~Species,ncol=3) 

```

* The Black-capped Chickadee is the only species present year round
* Migratory Species: Field Sparrow, Slate-colored Junco, and Tree Swallow
* American Goldflinch(October), Black-capped Chickadee (November), Field Sparrow(May), Slate-colored Junco(October), Tree Swallow(March)
* American Foldfinch, Black-capped Chickadee, Field Sparrow, Slate-colored Junco, Tree Swallow
